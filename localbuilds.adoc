# Local builds

## Introduction

This guide explains how to make your own local builds of various
Scheme implementations. That's useful if you want to:

* use pre-release versions to get the very latest features

* use custom build options

* use an operating system that does not have a ready-to-run package of
  the Scheme you want

## Installation prefix

On Unix-like operating systems, programs intended for all users are
usually installed into `/usr` or `/usr/local`.

For your own personal use, an emerging convention is to install into
`~/.local`, i.e. a directory named `.local` under your home directory.
This guide adopts that contention.

Most Schemes have a *prefix* option in their build system that can be
used to set the installation prefix to any directory you like. Hence,
if you want something different than `~/.local`, just change the
prefix.

## Chibi-Scheme

|=====
|*Implementation language:*|C interpreter and OS interface, Scheme libraries
|*Version control:*|Git
|*Build system:*|make
|*Full build with bootstrap:*|2 minutes
|*Documentation:*|doc/chibi.scrbl (Installation section)
|=====

-----
git clone https://github.com/ashinn/chibi-scheme.git
cd chibi-scheme
make PREFIX=$HOME/.local
make install PREFIX=$HOME/.local
-----

To run installed chibi you need to setup `$CHIBI_MODULE_PATH` (running
uninstalled does not need this because chibi can detect in that case).

-----
export CHIBI_MODULE_PATH=$HOME/.local/share/chibi:$HOME/.local/lib/chibi
-----

You may need to adjust `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` as well because chibi-scheme
binary does not have a default path for libchibi-scheme.so (you should
see "error while loading shared libraries" if it's the case)

-----
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/.local/lib
-----

### Troubleshooting

## Gambit

|=====
|*Implementation language:*|Scheme, with C for system interface
|*Version control:*|Git
|*Build system:*|GNU autotools & make
|*Full build with bootstrap:*|30 minutes
|=====

Gambit requires a pre-built version of its `gsc` compiler in order to
bootstrap itself. The bootstrap compiler is an executable at the root
of its source directory by the name `gsc-boot`. If `make` does not
find a `gsc-boot`, it looks for a `gsc` executable in `PATH` and makes
a copy of it as `gsc-boot`.

The usual way to get Gambit going on a new machine is to first install
the latest release version, then use that to bootstrap the latest git
master.

git clone https://github.com/gambit/gambit.git
cd gambit
./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
make
make modules
make install

### Performance

#### GCC vs clang

GNU's `gcc` compiler builds Gambit significantly faster than LLVM's
`clang` compiler. On some operating systems, notably MacOS, the `gcc`
command actually runs `clang` (whose command-line interface is largely
compatible with GNU `gcc`). You can check this with `gcc --version`:
the output should say `LLVM` if it's actually clang.

You can set the compiler command used to build Gambit like so:

`./configure CC=gcc-9`

Once Gambit has been built, there shouldn't be a substantial speed
difference between the resulting executables. It's just the build
itself that's slower with `clang`.

#### Optimized single-host build

`./configure --enable-single-host` generates a version of Gambit on
which a good C compiler is able to do whole-program optimization. The
resulting Gambit binaries can be significantly faster for
performance-sensitive software. However, building Gambit this way
takes a lot longer and requires more than a gigabyte of RAM.

For pedestrian Scheme code there is little to no perceptible speed
difference, so a non-single-host build is fine. Even a non-single-host
Gambit is easily one of the fastest Scheme implementations available.

Pre-packaged binaries of Gambit are generally single-host builds.

#### Parallel builds

`make -j` can significantly speed up Gambit builds if you have a fast
multi-core CPU and lots of RAM.

### Troubleshooting

Sometimes big changes are made to Gambit which break your build,
causing compiler errors (or in rare cases, a crashing `gsc` or `gsi`
executable). In that case, try deleting the `boot` directory and the
`gsc-boot` executable within Gambit's source directory (`rm -rf boot/
gsc-boot`). That forces `make` to do a full bootstrap. Beware that
this can take 30 minutes or more.

## Gauche

|=====
|*Implementation language:*|C and Scheme
|*Version control:*|Git
|*Build system:*|GNU autotools & make
|*Full build with bootstrap:*|5 minutes
|*Documentation:*|HACKING.adoc
|=====


Gauche requires the latest released version installed before you can
build from Git repository. Follow the documentation link below to get
the tarball and install. Remember to add `--prefix` when you
configure:

-----
# Browse http://practical-scheme.net/gauche/download.html
tar -xf Gauche-0.9.9.tgz
cd Gauche-0.9.9
./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
make
make install
-----

After this, make sure "gosh" is available. If not adjust `$PATH` for
the current shell:

-----
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin
-----

Now you can build from Git, the steps are almost identical as before,
except the new step `./DIST gen`.

-----
git clone https://github.com/shirok/Gauche.git gauche
cd gauche
./DIST gen
./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
make
make install
-----
