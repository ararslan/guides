## Recommended SRFIs

### R7RS Large Edition

These are SRFIs most widely supported by R7RS implementations, and on
track to be included in the upcoming Large Edition of the R7RS
language. Right now, it's generally best to use the SRFI imports to
get at these libraries. The R7RS-large library names are not yet as
portable.

[options=header]
|=====
|Task|Current SRFI import|Future R7RS-large import
|List library|`(srfi 1)`|`(scheme list)`
|Hash tables|`(srfi 125)`|`(scheme hash-table)`
|Sort libraries|`(srfi 132)`|`(scheme sort)`
|Bitwise operations|`(srfi 151)`|`(scheme bitwise)`
|=====

### Other

The following SRFIs are the most widely supported ones for tasks that
R7RS-large is not currently planned to cover:

[options=header]
|=====
|Task|SRFI import
|Environment variables|`(srfi 98)`
