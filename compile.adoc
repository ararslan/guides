# Working with the compiler

This guide shows how to compile, optimize and deploy code in various
Scheme implementations. It does not go in depth into implementation
internals and how to optimize code for particular tasks.

## Gambit Scheme

### Overview

The Gambit compiler translates Scheme to C, and then calls upon the
system C compiler to turn that C into standard object files (ELF, COFF
or Mach-O).

### Shell command

The compiler is `gsc` (also accessible by the alias `gsc-script` -- on
some operating systems `gsc` is GhostScript, not Gambit). `gsc` is the
same program as the interpreter `gsi` but includes extra libraries
that implement the compiler.

### Help

`gsc -help` shows usage.

The http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~gambit/doc/gambit.html[Gambit manual]
has details.

The Gambit mailing list is the best place to ask for help with more
difficult problems.

### Showing optimized Scheme code

`gsc -expansion foo.scm`

### Showing disassembly of compiled Scheme code

`rm -f foo.o1 && gsc foo.scm && objdump -d foo.o1`

### Caveats

* `gsc` generates object files `foo.o1`, `foo.o2`, `foo.o3`, etc.
  These are ordinary object files like `foo.o` from the C compiler but
  have a running number at the end of the filename. Beware of commands
  like `objdump -d foo.o1` that refer to a particular number; it may
  be an old object file left over from a previous `gsc` run.

* If a pre-release version of `gsc` produces a mysterious failure, try
  removing all object and executable files generated by previous runs
  in the same directory and compiling your code from scratch. `gsc`
  can use existing files as cached build steps, and things sometimes
  get out of sync.
